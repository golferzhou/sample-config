World without poverty

My name is Rain, I am a Grade 4 student from Longhua Foreign language school in Shenzhen china.
My topic is world without poverty

Ladies and gentlemen

I am a representative from China.

China is the first developing country that solve the extreme poverty problem. Over the past years, our government has made many policies to help people live a better life. For example, in 2020, some farmers in poor cannot sell their vegetables because of the Epidemic. When they were in trouble, our government sent volunteers to help them deliver their vegetables to big cities, so that the farmers can earn money and people in cities can buy fresh food. They both solved their problems.  

However, there is still many people cannot get adequate education and professional medical care.  In urban areas, many children donâ€™t have the chance to go to school, because they live inside the mountain far away from the nearest school. Teacher is very few there. For a low- income family, a serious illness can easily let them return to poverty because they cannot afford the huge medical fee.  

We need a sustainable measure to totally end the poverty. And we need your help. For all the member countries, if you have good practice of solving such problems, we will be very appreciate if you can share your experiences and offer the necessary help to us. Of course, China are also pleased to offer our help to you. 

The earth is a small town. Let us work together to think out good ideas, and work hard to carry to plan. And I wish there is a world without poverty in the near future. 

Thank you very much.
